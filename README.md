# Pregnancy & Birth Guide — PWA

An evidence-based, fully offline-capable Progressive Web App for pregnant patients. Covers prenatal visits, labor & delivery, postpartum recovery, newborn care, FAQ, and 10 interactive clinical tools — all stored privately on the patient's device.

## Features

- **Works 100% offline** — service worker caches everything after first load
- **Installable** — iOS and Android home screen
- **10 interactive tools** — kick counter, contraction timer, feeding log, diaper log, jaundice tracker, blood pressure log, weight tracker, mood check-in (EPDS), birth plan builder, visit notes
- **Dark mode** — respects system preference, user-toggleable
- **Full-text search** across all content
- **Data export** — download all your data as a JSON file
- **Print-ready birth plan** — clean layout for printing or saving as PDF
- **Tap-to-call / tap-to-text** saved care team contacts
- **No ads, no tracking, no data collection** — everything stays on the device
- **Multilingual** — English, Spanish, French, Korean, Arabic (RTL), Russian, Chinese, Zomi.
  First-run picker prompts in every language; English is the fallback for any
  untranslated string. See `TRANSLATING.md`.

## File Structure

```
index.html      HTML shell — all pages and modals, no inline JS or CSS
styles.css      All styles, including tool UI and dark mode
content.js      Card structure, navigation, search, My Info, PWA logic
tools.js        All 10 interactive tools
i18n/i18n.js    i18n runtime (locale detect/load, t(), search folding, formatting)
i18n/locale.*.js  One file per language; en is the fallback layer
sw.js           Service worker (offline caching, cache-first strategy)
manifest.json   PWA metadata (name, icons, theme color)
README.md       This file
```

To update content, edit `i18n/locale.en.js` (the `content` object, keyed by card
id) — and mirror the change into the other locale files. Card icons/colors live
in `CONTENT_STRUCTURE` in `content.js`.
After any change, bump the cache version in `sw.js` (`CACHE_NAME = 'birth-guide-v3'` etc.) so users get the update.
